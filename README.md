# Spotify Playlist Merger

## Description

Spotify Playlist Merger is a tool that lets you append your liked Spotify songs to any of your playlists, maintaining the original (reverse chronological) order. The tool ensures that only songs not already present in the target playlist are added.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Uses OAuth2 with Spotify for secure login.
- **Fetch Liked Songs**: Retrieves all your liked songs.
- **Playlist Selection**: Lets you choose the target playlist via an interactive menu.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Only adds songs not already in the target playlist.
- **Reverse Chronological Order**: Adds songs from newest to oldest.
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large playlists efficiently (max 100 songs per API call).
- **Backup**: Optionally backup your liked songs to a JSON file.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpotifyPlaylistMerger.git
   cd SpotifyPlaylistMerger
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Spotify API credentials:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
     ```
     CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
     CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
     ```
   - You can get these credentials by registering an app at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## Usage

1. **Run the tool:**
   ```sh
   python scripts/main.py
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   python scripts/liked_songs_merger.py
   ```

2. **Follow the interactive process:**
   - The tool will open your browser for Spotify authentication.
   - After login, it will fetch your liked songs and playlists.
   - Select a target playlist from the menu.
   - Review the songs to be added (displayed newest first).
   - Confirm to add the songs to your selected playlist.

## Example Workflow

1. Run `python scripts/main.py`
2. Browser opens for Spotify login.
3. Select target playlist from menu.
4. Review the list of songs to add.
5. Confirm addition.
6. Songs are added in reverse chronological order (newest first).

## File Structure

- `scripts/liked_songs_merger.py`: Main script for merging liked songs into a playlist.
- `scripts/main.py`: Entry point and core Spotify API functions.
- `scripts/localServer.py`: Local server for OAuth callback handling.
- `scripts/colors.py`: Terminal color formatting utilities.
- `scripts/helpful_fuctions.py`: Utility functions.
- `scripts/terminal_menu.py`: (Optional) Enhanced terminal menu for advanced operations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: Make sure your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are correct in the `.env` file.
- **API Limits**: The tool respects Spotify's 100 tracks per request limit.
- **Error Handling**: Most errors are displayed in the terminal. If you encounter issues, check your internet connection and credentials.

## Additional notes (auth, tokens, and security)

### Spotify app setup (redirect URI)

- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
- Create (or select) your app and set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback` (or update `REDIRECT_URI` in your `.env`).
- Make sure your app's client ID and client secret are set in your environment (see below).

### Required environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is ignored by git). Example `.env`:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

The project uses `python-dotenv` to load these values at runtime.

### Token storage and logout

- After the first successful authentication the tool saves tokens to `~/.spotify_tokens.json` by default. This file contains your `access_token`, `refresh_token` (if provided), and expiry timestamp. It is stored locally so you won't need to log in every run.
- To logout or force re-authentication, delete the token file:

```powershell
del $env:USERPROFILE\.spotify_tokens.json
```

or on Unix-like systems:

```sh
rm ~/.spotify_tokens.json
```

### Switching to OS keyring (recommended)

Storing tokens in the OS keyring (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or a Linux secret store) is more secure than a plain file. If you'd like, the code can be switched to use the `keyring` package. This repository currently uses a simple file fallback; migrating to `keyring` is straightforward and I can implement it for you.

### How the popup auth flow behaves

- The app opens a small local launcher HTML that opens the Spotify authorization page in a popup. Because the popup is opened by script, the redirect page is allowed to call `window.close()` and will usually close itself after authentication.
- If the browser blocks popups or if the popup cannot close (some browsers block window.close on tabs), the redirect page displays a fallback button to manually close the tab.
- The launcher improves the auto-close behavior compared to opening the auth URL directly, but it is still subject to browser policies.

If you want absolute reliability and OS-level app switching, consider registering a custom URI scheme (e.g. `myapp://callback`) and using that as the redirect URI â€” this requires additional OS-specific setup.
